Simple Overview: Community Science Museum Website Project
Objective: Develop a responsive, engaging website for the Community Science Museum, targeting middle school pupils (ages 7-15) and families.

## Description

he description you provided outlines a project where you need to create a website for the Community Science Museum. This museum, targeting middle school children and families with young children, requires a website that is both informative and engaging. The key goal is to create a site that appeals to young, curious minds without being condescending, encouraging them to visit the museum.

Your task involves using provided media assets effectively in your design, which must consider the target audience's preferences in terms of layout, color schemes, and typography. The website should have 4-6 pages, be fast-loading with optimized images, and be accessible according to WCAG standards.

The project also demands a high level of technical proficiency in HTML and CSS, with an emphasis on semantic structuring and adherence to the DRY principle in CSS. Additionally, the site must be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices.

You are required to submit a live version of the site, a prototype, your code repository on GitHub, and a detailed report discussing the design and technical aspects, including how you handled WCAG guidelines, SEO, and content management. The duration of the project is specified as four weeks for full-time students and eight weeks for part-time students.
